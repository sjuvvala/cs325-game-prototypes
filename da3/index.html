<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>I was able to make the platforms so that you can move across them yet jump on top of them</li>
<li>Tried using some_key.downDuration to determine how long a key has been pressed--in this case, the spacebar</li>
<li>If you overlap the gray cat and press the spacebar, its eyes will progressivly turn green</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>Not knowing how to program. I have the ideas, just don't know how to properly implement them</li>
<li>The effort I've been putting into this is not worth the result. Also there isn't enough time and I was being too ambitious</li>
<ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Everything was made by me</li>
<li>except for the old lady which I havent been able to put in the game yet <a href ="http://clipart-library.com/ladies-knitting-cliparts.html">...</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li> <a href=https://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/keyboard-justpressed>justpressed</a></li>
<li> <a href=https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/one-way-collision>one way collision</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game:
<p>Avoid getting caught by the old lady as you brainwash/hypnotize all her cats<p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>"a person with lots of cats"</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<li>move with arrow keys, approach a cat, hypnotize with spacebar</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<li>The game is about an alien cat that breaks into this old lady's house and brainwashes/hypnotizes her cats to join its army</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<li> Anyone. This game is simple and doesn't require much skill</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
