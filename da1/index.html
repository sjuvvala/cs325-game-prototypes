<h2>First Game</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Um, I made that creature sprite.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There isn't much of this at all. This game was designed to be easy to program, but even that took an entire day to do.
There was some experimentation with the physics stuff regarding the bouncing balls. 
I had to place them in such a way they can bounce off each other--at first, they would all move in unison accross the screen,
which was not what I wanted. I created a group of ball objects so it can be easier to program them to bounce off each other. 
</li>
    
<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
Easiest part: refering to pre-existing code
Hardest part: not understanding Phaser and feeling like a failure
I need to put some time aside and learn Phaser
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not sure off the top of my head, but it definately isn't a new concept
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move around and avoid the red dots
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Move around with the mouse--the creature will follow the mouse. The red dots will kill you, so you must avoid them. If you touch one of them, you die.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are no strategies, just avoid the red dots the best you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is no story. The purple creature is placed in this hell-like dimension where red dots try to attack it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
It's a simple game anyone can play, so no particular target audience.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
 As long as the player stays alive.
</li>

</ul>
