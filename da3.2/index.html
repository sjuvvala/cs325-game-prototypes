<h2>alien cat</h2>
<p> it took me 5 days to make this garbage, but now I'm using this for DA5</p>
<p> even though this wasn't the game I proposed</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>I came up with this idea and I don't think there's a game exactly like this--maybe some that are similar</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>I was able to make the platforms so that you can move across them yet jump on top of them</li>
<li>Tried using some_key.downDuration to determine how long a key has been pressed--in this case, the spacebar</li>
<ul><li>If you overlap the any cat and press the spacebar, its eyes will progressivly turn green</li></ul>
<li>I was successfully able to randomize the old lady's actions</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>Not knowing what to do is the most difficult. I have the ideas, just don't know how to properly implement them</li>
<li>The effort I've been putting into this is not worth the result. Also there isn't enough time and I was being too ambitious</li>
<li>maybe not too ambitious, but it took me forever to figure out how to get it to work</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Everything was made by me</li>
<li>except for the old lady <a href ="http://clipart-library.com/ladies-knitting-cliparts.html">found here</a></li>
<li>and the music: Humanfobia-Alien Radar from freemusicarchive.org </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>This is based on those weird kissing games found on GirlsGoGames, one of my favorite free game websites back in elementary school</li>
<ul><li>in these games you basically had to make out without getting caught as long as possible</li></ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li> <a href=https://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/keyboard-justpressed>justpressed</a></li>
<li> <a href=https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/one-way-collision>one way collision</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game:
<ul>
<li>Avoid getting caught by the old lady as you brainwash/hypnotize all her cats</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>"a person with lots of cats"</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>the old lady's movements are randomized</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>interacting with objects in the game</li>
<li>randomness and time based events</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>nothing in particular--the game is pretty boring honestly</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>move with arrow keys, approach/overlap a cat, hypnotize with spacebar</li>
<li>brainwashing will restart if not completed in one go</li>
<li>avoid hypnotizing when old lady is looking</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>the old lady will look up everytime before she turns around to check on her cats</li>
<li>but she will also look up without turing around sometimes, so it's up to you to decide if it's worth the risk to keep hypnotizing when she looks up</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul><li>The game is about an alien cat that breaks into this old lady's house and brainwashes/hypnotizes her cats to join its army</li>
<li>The game at this point lacks any cutscences to show this</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul><li> Anyone. This game is simple and doesn't require any skill</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul><li>less than 2 minutes</li></ul>
</li>

</ul>
