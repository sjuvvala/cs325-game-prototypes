<h2>not really a game</h2>
<p>but an interactive time waster</p2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>There isn't a game, if I can even call it a game, like this anywhere</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>I was experimenting with p2 physics. I tried to implement ragdoll physics but it turned into something else</li>
<li>the physics in general are not perfect</li>
<li>I don't know what it's called, but I reshaped the components of the stuffed animal thing instead of it being a bunch of rectangular objects</li>
<li>I also added a feature to change the background by pressing B on the keyboard</li>
<li>Added some relaxing music which can be played and paused by pressing M, but this breaks after a while and I don't know why</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>I learned more about Phaser, and programming wasn't too difficult this time</li>
<li>But by trying to learn, I sacrified the quality of the game.</li>
<li>I would have been better off making a simple platformer instead of trying something new</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Everything is self-made except for two of the backgrounds, the music, and the annoying sound effect</li>
<li><a href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/These-Photos-Will-Remind-You-Of-The-Classic-Windows-XP-Wallpaper-593913d627b78__880.jpg">Windows XP wallpaper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1828442.jpg">chickens</a></li>
<li>music used: Satan's Smile by Bloodgod from freemusicarchive.org</li>
<li>dont remember where I found the swing sound effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/platformer-material">platformer materical</a></li>
<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/contact-events">contact events</a></li>
<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/chain">chain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/time/elapsed-seconds">elapsed seconds</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game
<ul>
<li>attack the stuffed animal thing</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>enormous stuffed animal</li>
<li>also chicken if you count one of the backgrounds</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>there is some randomness in determining how far the stuffed animal gets launched, which is unecessary but it's there</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>nothing profound, just attacking things in an unrealistic way and other useless effects</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>I intended this to be a sort of stress relief game but it ends up causing more stress, at least for me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>move with right and left arrow keys, jump with up, and attack with spacebar or down arrow key </li>
<li>also you need to collide with the stuffed animal in order to attack it</li>
<li>change background with 'B'</li>
<li>pause/play music with 'M'</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>there are no strategies required</li>
<li>it is prefered that you don't think and aimlessly attack</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>The demon girl character I made will be the protagonist for my next game, one that will be better than the garbage I've created so far, hopefully</li>
<li>The story for now: the unnamed demon girl is weak and she hopes to get stronger, so she trains by beating up a large stuffed animal</li>
<li>Or, she hopes to one day get revenge on someone and is planning to attack them just like she attacks the stuffed animal</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
<li>no one in particular</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
<li>as long as you want</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
